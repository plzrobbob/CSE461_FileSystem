# CSE461_FileSystem
This is the project I completed for CSE 461 - Advanced Operating Systems. The projects goal was to simulate a disk drive. We were given a large amount of data and were tasked with putting it into a file and reading particular bits of the data and returning all the related information on that particular piece of data.
